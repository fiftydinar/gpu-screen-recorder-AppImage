# gpu-screen-recorder-AppImage

Because this application uses `pidof` to find if existing binaries are running, it is not possible to use `ARGV0` to launch the multiple different binaries in this AppImage. 

* The AppImage defaults to running `gpu-screen-recorder-gtk`.

* in order to launch the ui overlay you need to pass `gsr-ui` as first argument to the AppImage: 

```
./gpu-screen-recorder-anylinux-x86_64.AppImage gsr-ui
```

* And so on for `gpu-screen-recorder` and all other bundled binaries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun), which makes it extremely easy to turn any binary into a portable package without using containers or similar tricks.

**This AppImage bundles everything and should work on any linux distro, even on musl based ones.**

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, I recommend these alternatives instead: 

* [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) `am -i gpu-screen-recorder` or `appman -i gpu-screen-recorder`

* [dbin](https://github.com/xplshn/dbin) `dbin install gpu-screen-recorder.appimage`

* [soar](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar) `soar install gpu-screen-recorder`

This appimage works without fuse2 as it can use fuse3 instead, it can also work without fuse at all thanks to the [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime)
